// sign-in by a different user on the same browser tab doesn't inherit the
// previous user's optimistic-render hints, queued wizard payloads, or saved
// search filters.
//
// This intentionally only touches in-process state; persisted KV (session
// token, cached themes, etc.) is the responsibility of the caller, since
// what to clear there depends on whether the sign-out is by user choice or
// by hard failure (e.g. revoked session) and which keys are user-scoped vs
// device-scoped.
