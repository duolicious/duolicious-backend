`model.onnx` was derived from
[https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model](https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model).
`nsfw_model` provides a
[Tensorflow 299x299 Image Model](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ir_public/ai/nsfw_models/nsfw.299x299.pb)
which was simply converted to an ONNX model using commonly available tools.
