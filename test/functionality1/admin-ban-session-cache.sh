# Regression test for the session cache on the admin-ban path (see
# sessioncache/ and `delete_or_ban_account` in service/person/__init__.py).
#
# Banning a user runs through `delete_or_ban_account(s=None, ...)` — there is no
# calling session, so eviction relies entirely on looking the banned person's
# session tokens up by `person_id`. This test confirms a banned user's cached
# session stops authenticating immediately rather than lingering until the TTL.
#
# See delete-account-session-cache.sh for why `/search-clubs` (not
# `/check-session-token`) is the probe endpoint.
