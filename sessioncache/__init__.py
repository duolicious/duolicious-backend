"""
Redis-backed cache for the per-request session lookup performed by
`require_auth` (see service/api/decorators.py).

Every authenticated request resolves its bearer token to a `SessionInfo` by
running `Q_GET_SESSION` against Postgres. That query is a primary-key point
read, but the Flask API funnels *all* of its database work through a single
shared connection guarded by a process-wide lock (`_api_conn_lock` in
database/__init__.py), so the lookup serializes every authenticated request
behind that lock. Caching the resolved session in Redis keeps the common case
(a valid, unchanged session) off both the lock and the database entirely.

Correctness model
-----------------
The cache is keyed by `session_token_hash` and stores only the fields
`require_auth` needs. The cached fields are nearly immutable per token; the
few mutations that change them invalidate the entry explicitly via
`delete_session()`:

  * sign-out                  -> session deleted        (post_sign_out)
  * OTP sign-in               -> `signed_in` flips TRUE (post_check_otp)
  * finish onboarding         -> `person_id` is set     (post_finish_onboarding)
  * search-preference update  -> `pending_club_name`    (get_search)
                                 cleared
  * self account deletion     -> session cascade-deleted (delete_or_ban_account)

`SESSION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` is the backstop for everything explicit
invalidation can't cover immediately:

  * Paths that can't supply a token hash cheaply — admin bans and account
    deletes affecting a person's *other* sessions, and the auto-deactivate
    cron (a separate process). Those delete sessions by `person_id`, and the
    cache has no person -> hashes index, so the entries age out within the TTL.
  * The read-then-recache race: a request that misses the cache reads the row
    from Postgres and then writes it back; if an invalidating mutation lands in
    that (sub-millisecond, no-lock-held) window, the re-write can resurrect the
    just-stale row. Worst case it stays cached for one TTL.

So the TTL is the true upper bound on staleness for every field; explicit
invalidation only shrinks the common case to ~immediate.

Redis is treated as a best-effort accelerator: any Redis error degrades to a
cache miss / no-op so authentication keeps working off Postgres alone.
