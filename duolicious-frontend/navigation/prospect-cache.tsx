// Optimistic rendering cache for prospect-related navigation.
//
// When navigating from a list (inbox, search, feed, visitors) to a prospect's
// profile or conversation screen, we often already have partial data like the
// user's name, primary photo UUID and blurhash. Passing those through React
// Navigation's `route.params` leaks them into the URL, so instead callers can
// stash them here and the target screen reads them as a hint while fetching
// the authoritative copy via the API.

  // Numeric id used by some legacy endpoints (compare-answers,
  // compare-personalities). Cached so screens that need it don't have to
  // round-trip through `/prospect-profile/:uuid` again.

  // bottom action buttons (send intro etc.) would be redundant - notably the
  // conversation screen, where the user is already messaging that person.

// Cap so a long-running session doesn't slowly accumulate every prospect
// the user has ever interacted with. `Map` preserves insertion order, so we
// can use it as a cheap LRU: bumping a key on touch keeps the most recently
// used entries near the tail and the oldest near the head for eviction.
