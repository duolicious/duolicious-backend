# These live here (not in person/sql) so the cron process can run
# them without importing person, which builds a boto3 client and
# pulls in Flask/PIL/etc. at import time.
#
# Personality maths: `person.personality` is a 47-dim pgvector (46 traits
# + 1 padding dim), unit-normalised and then scaled by an answer-count
# weight, so each component lies in [-1, 1]. The per-trait mean across
# members therefore also lies in [-1, 1], with +/-1 meaning every member's
# vector points entirely along that dim. Multiplying by 100 turns that
# into an interpretable -100..100 lean; the clamp is defence in depth.
#
# Lookup tables store id = 1 as "Unanswered" for every attribute except
# `gender` (where id = 1 is the real value "Man"), so the demographic CTEs
# exclude id = 1 everywhere except gender.
