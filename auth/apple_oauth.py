Apple Sign In with Apple — web/Android OAuth callback.

iOS uses the native Sign In with Apple API (expo-apple-authentication)
and never hits this endpoint. Android and web have no native Apple SDK,
so they use the OAuth web flow against a Services ID:

    1. Client builds an authorize URL pointing at appleid.apple.com.
    2. User signs in.
    3. Apple POSTs the result (form-encoded) back to a Return URL
       registered on the Services ID.
    4. Browsers can't navigate to a POST response, so the Return URL has
       to be a server endpoint that converts POST -> 302 redirect.

This module is that converter. It pulls the `id_token` out of the form
post and 302s back to a client-controlled URL with the token in a query
parameter, so the originating client can hand it to /sign-in-with-apple.

The redirect target is *not* picked by the client URL-side — that would
be an open redirect. Instead, the client encodes a target name (`web`
or `android`) inside the OAuth `state` parameter, which Apple echoes
back unchanged. We resolve that name against an env-configured
allow-list.

Env vars:
    DUO_APPLE_WEB_REDIRECT_URL      Final redirect target after a web
                                    sign-in. Typically the SPA root.
    DUO_APPLE_ANDROID_REDIRECT_URL  Final redirect target after an
                                    Android sign-in. Must be the
                                    Universal Link / App Link the
                                    Android client passes to
                                    expo-web-browser as `returnUrl`.
