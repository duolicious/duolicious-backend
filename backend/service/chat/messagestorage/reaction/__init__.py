"""
Persistence for emoji message reactions.

A reaction is stored directly on the target message's `mam_message` rows (the
`reaction` column) rather than as separate rows, so old clients never replay it
as a text bubble. Reactions are keyed on the server-assigned `mam_message.id`
(never the client-supplied `stanza_id`).

A message is archived as two rows whose ids differ only in the low bit -- the
sender copy is `microseconds << 8` and the recipient copy is that value `+ 1`
(see `Q_INSERT_MESSAGE` in `service/chat/messagestorage/mam`). So the partner's
copy of any message is `id ^ 1`. A reaction updates both copies by their
`(person_id, id)` primary key.

A user may only react to the *other* person's messages, so the reactor's update
is guarded by `direction = 'I'`. Each message therefore has at most one
reaction, and who reacted is implied by the row's `direction`.

The partner (whose message is being reacted to) is always *derived* from the
reactor's own incoming copy via `fetch_reaction_partner`, never trusted from the
client, so a reaction can't be aimed at an arbitrary third party.

The target row is guaranteed to already exist: a message is delivered to the
recipient only by the batcher's post-flush callback (see `Batcher._process_batch`),
so no client can learn a message's `mam_id` until after its rows are committed.
A missing target therefore means a genuinely absent or own-message reaction, not
a not-yet-flushed one.
