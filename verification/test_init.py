You have been given one or more image(s) by a user attempting to verify their identity on a social media website. The user provides Image #1 as proof of their identity. The user makes some claims about the image(s). Provide a JSON object in the following format which assigns a probability from 0.0 to 1.0 to each claim being true:

```typescript
{
  // Image #1 was not edited
  image_1_was_not_edited: number

  // Image #1 is a photograph
  image_1_is_photograph: number

  // Image #1 shows no signs of being a screenshot or photograph of a computer screen
  image_1_is_not_screenshot: number

  // Image #1 contains at least one person
  image_1_has_at_least_one_person: number

  // Image #1 contains exactly one person
  image_1_has_exactly_one_person: number

  // Image #1 contains a person whose gender is: Woman.
  // When checking this claim, note that the user chose this gender from these options: Man, Woman, Agender, Femboy, Intersex, Non-binary, Transgender, Trans woman, Trans man, and Other.
  // In equivocal cases, prefer probabilities near 1.0.
